Task 3
Calculate what would be the LCU capacity and the monthly cost for operating an AWS Application Load Balancer in
Frankfurt region with the following details:
• 26.6 new connections / s
• 27 active connections / s (each connection lasting 50 ms)
• processed 15 000 000 Bytes per minute

==================


APPROACH:

Following the link:
https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/

we can find tarif for EU FFM:

$0.027 per Application Load Balancer-hour (or partial hour)
$0.008per LCU-hour (or partial hour)



Then substitute our values in the calculation examples of first 3  dimensions



UA EAST tarif
$0.0225 per Application Load Balancer-hour (or partial hour)
$0.008per LCU-hour (or partial hour)


DIMENSION 1

  New connections (per second): Each LCU provides 25 new connections per second (averaged over the hour). 
  Since your application receives 26.6 new connection per second, 
  this translates to 1.064 LCUs (26.6 connection per second / 25 connections per second)

DIMENSION 2

Active connections (per minute): Each LCU provides 3,000 active connections per minute. 
Your application receives 26.6 new connection per second, each lasting 50 ms. 
This translates to  0.000665 active connections per minute, or 0.000000222 LCUs 
(0.000665 active connections per minute / 3,000 active connections per minute)

DIMENSION 3

Processed Bytes (GBs per hour): Each LCU provides 1 GB of processed bytes per hour. 
Since each the total processed given is 15000000, or ~ 15MB , 
it translates to 0.015 GB per hour or 0.015 LCUs (15 MB/1 GB).


since there is no number of Rule Evaluation given, we do not know how to calculate DIMENSION4, so we have to omit it.

From the 3 above the New Connection LCU is the biggest, thus is selected

1.064 LCU  * 0.008 per LCU = $0.008512 per hour or $6.12864 per month
